# How to contribute

If you read those lines, either you are a curious being or you want to contribute to this wonderful adventure. Anyway, I'm glad you are currently reading those lines because this project needs your help and your vision to make a greater project together.

If you don't know yet, this project is written in Go and it should use all the standard tools used by the Go Community.

Anybody can contribute, even if this project is designed by and for the 42 Community.

You can contribute in many ways:
* Submiting a bug on our Issueboard
* Submitting an idea
* Discuss about a new feature on an issue
* Resolving an Issue by submitting your Pull request

## Usefull Resources

* Our code of conduct (available in this file)
* [A tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/) 
* [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
* The 42 Norm (available in French and English in this)

---

## Submit a bug or an idea a.k.a. Using the Issueboard

Every bug, idea, task or question must be logged on our [Issueboard](https://github.com/c-t-n/ziggurat/issues) for tracability. This project is focused for 42, and even if its community is active mostly on Slack, we decided that everything inside the Boards and the docs of this repository are the only source of truth for everyone.

The rules for submiting something are simple:
* You are posting because you strongly believe your point is relevant
* You must post your text according to our code of conduct
* If you create an issue, you should provide a trace with the tested file and the standard output
* If you create an idea, you should explain your point in the most detailled way

Our Core Team will moderate your issues and validate your point (or not.............. because we can)

## Submit your Pull Request

If you want to contribute in our code base, you should do it with our developper guidelines:

* Every feature is tested, and tests are provided for at least all use cases
* Tests are written and updated first, code goes after
* Your code should be maintainable by everyone, so make it simple and clear...
* ... and if you don't know how to do it, stick to the code design we use.
* A clear and efficient documentation should be provided with your code.
* Your contribution must compile with the rest of the code base (at least for Mac OS X)
* Your contribution need the approbation of at least one of the core team member before merging
* Your contribution need to pass all the tests before merging
* Our Core Team doesn't push anything on production on Friday night... for obvious reasons.
